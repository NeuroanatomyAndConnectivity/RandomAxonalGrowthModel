	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	From below this point, the code could and should be altered to fit your needs
	
	Explanation: A neuron generator produces neurons and give it to the simulation
	instance. The simulation instance cares about all technical details, like 
	computing distances, do not allow overlapping neurons, make connections 
	between axons and neurons, doing statistics and much more.
	
	The neuron generator holds all crucial information about placing neurons:
	when, where and especially which. So you can have many different neuron 
	classes acting differently, but you can only have one generator. This 
	generator then specifies, which class to use and when etc.
	
	Every new neuron class has to implement the methods defined in TrivialNeuron
	(see above). This is easily done by inherit from it. It is shown in the 
	definition of SimpleNeuron. As you can see TrivialNeuron is in the parenthesis
	and therefore SimpleNeuron inherits all methods and property from TrivialNeuron.
	You can now reimplement the methods you like to alter and even create new
	methods and properties.
	The same is true for the SimpleNeurongenerator.
	
	In general the simulation ends, when they aren't any active neurons on the
	field. A neuron is active, as soon as is placed and will be deactived if 
	one of the 2 cases hold: its axon reaches the border or it can't make a 
	connection any more. A once deactivated neuron can't be activated again.
	Though the simulation would therefor never start, you have to provde a 
	minimum iteration length, which will definitly be simulated. After that 
	the above criteria holds.
	
	As you can see in the last lines: The Simulation class is the main object
	which organizes all and calls the rest of the code. Thats why you create
	an instance of it providing your generator. After that you start the
	simulation by calling simulate(). And finally cou can call any of the 
	statistics methods provided.
	
	The simulation uses a heuristic to determine when a container is defined
	full and that it can not add more neurons to it (because there is no more 
	free space left). It tracks how much space is used by the neurons and how
	big is the area in which they should be placed. If this ratio exceeds a
	certain value it gets more difficult to find free space to place a new one.
	Therefor there exist a certain threshold at which neurons won't be placed
	anymore - this parameter can be set by calling
	set_container_capacity_heuristic_limit. Normally this value is set to 0.55
	and setting it higher will increase the time to compute exponentially.
	Though the placement is random in nature, this value can't be tingled 
	exactly.
	This procedure is done to prevent the simulation from getting into a 
	endless loop. (as Sharzad already pointed out)
	
	Normally the simulation is now silent. To increase its level of chattiness
	call the function set_verbosity(1) or something similar.
	Additionally call print_simulation_meta_data() to print meta information
	about the computation (like area capacity) and compute_statistics() to
	generate and print the distance density bins.
	
	If you use many neurons and a large areas, you can use an indexing structure
	to (theoretically) speed up the computation. Just call use_geotree(True) 
	to use it or use_geotree(False) to switch it off again. Switching it on 
	or off during simulation will lead to errors and will break it. 
	It is recommend to firstly consider it, if you plan to put 1000 neurons
	and more.
